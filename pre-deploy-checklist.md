- [ ] Error messages are announced

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Can navigate entire site without mouse
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Skip links work (if implemented)
- [ ] Escape key closes modals/dropdowns
- [ ] Tab order is logical

### Visual Accessibility

- [ ] Migration guide updated (if breaking changes)
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated

## âœ… Code Quality

- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint warnings
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks
- [ ] No TODO comments that should be resolved

## âœ… Build & Deployment

- [ ] Build completes without warnings
- [ ] Bundle size is reasonable (check for regressions)
- [ ] Source maps are generated correctly
- [ ] CDN URLs work (if applicable)
- [ ] NPM package publishes correctly (dry run first)

## âœ… Security

- [ ] No exposed API keys or secrets
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers are correct
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities in user inputs
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date (no critical vulnerabilities)

## âœ… Integration Testing

- [ ] Test in a real project (React app)
- [ ] Test in a Vue.js project
- [ ] Test in vanilla JavaScript project
- [ ] Verify TypeScript types work correctly
- [ ] Test both CDN and NPM installation methods

## âœ… Final Checks

- [ ] Version number bumped appropriately
- [ ] Git tag created for release
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] All tests pass in CI
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] PR approved by reviewer (if applicable)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

1. Run automated tests: `npm run test:pre-deploy`
2. Complete this manual checklist
3. Build packages: `npm run build`
4. Publish to NPM: `npm publish --dry-run` then `npm publish`
5. Deploy documentation: `npm run deploy:docs`
6. Create GitHub release with changelog
7. Announce in Discord/Slack (if applicable)

## ðŸ”¥ Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. Revert to previous NPM version: `npm deprecate @pm7/core@[bad-version] "Critical bug"`
2. Revert documentation if needed
3. Communicate issue to users
4. Fix issue and re-deploy with patch version

**Remember**: It's better to delay a release than to ship broken code. Take your time with this checklist!
